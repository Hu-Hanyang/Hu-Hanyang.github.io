## About Me
Hi, I’m a Ph.D. candidate in Computing Science at <a href="https://www.sfu.ca/" target="_blank"> Simon Fraser University</a>, advised by Prof.<a href="https://scholar.google.ca/citations?user=19UAgLUAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao" target="_blank"> Mo Chen</a>. My research involves combining control theory with reinforcement learning method.

Before enrolling in the Ph.D. program, I got my master's degree in Power Engineering and Engineering Thermophysics from <a href="https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/" target = "_blank"> Tsinghua University</a>, and my bachelor's degree in Vehicle Engineering from <a href="https://www.jlu.edu.cn/" target = "_blank"> Jilin University</a>.

During my free time, I like to play badminton and listen to music to relax.
