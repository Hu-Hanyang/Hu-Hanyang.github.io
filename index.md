## About Me (Under construction, 20240424)
Hi, Iâ€™m a Ph.D. student in Computing Science at <a href="https://www.sfu.ca/" target="_blank"> Simon Fraser University</a>, advised by Prof.<a href="https://scholar.google.ca/citations?user=19UAgLUAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN&oi=ao" target="_blank"> Mo Chen</a>. My research involves combining control theory with reinforcement learning method.
